# wplace-stamp
its a tool for copy pasting any existing artwork to any other place on wplace (its an ahk script so the copy location and target location have to be on screen for it to copy)

## HALT THE PROGRAM WITH SHIFT+ESC ANYTIME

1. you open the file and specify the art size.
2. you run the file
3. you press s on the top left (of existing art)
4. then again on bottom left (-||-)
5. then one last time at the bottom left you want it to go.
6. wait for the magic to happen. (it takes some time idk how to make it any faster) (its also in screenspace and uses the mouse rendering your pc useless while copying)
